# Gradebook

Gradebook is an open-source product for instructors to record student assessment
and attendance. It is developed at the Data Science & Systems Lab ([DASSL](https://dassl.github.io),
read _dazzle_) at the Western Connecticut State University ([WCSU](http://wcsu.edu/)).

## Goals
Gradebook is developed with the following goals:
1. Provide instructors a free, open, and modern tool to record student
assessment and attendance
2. Provide instructors a framework to surface, analyze, and visualize patterns
in student performance
3. Use (and demonstrate the use of) modern tools and processes in software and
data engineering
4. Provide Computer Science students a real-life application to develop and
maintain as both curricular and co-curricular activity
5. Provide Computer Science students a framework to experience first-hand topics
such as: web and mobile application development; RESTful APIs; multi-tenancy;
scalability; and cloud-based services.

## Status

Gradebook is still in early stages of development ("alpha stage"). Much of its external
documentation is in the form of README files contained in various directories
within the product repository. The source code is commented reasonably well.

__Caution:__ Because the product is still in very early stages of development,
it should not be used as a production system in its current state. There are no
guarantees that future development releases will provide any kind of backward
compatibility or portability.

## Installation

To install Gradebook, follow the instructions in the README files in the
following directories: `/src/db` and `/src/webapp`.

To populate the Gradebook database with sample data, consult the README file in
the directory `/tests/data`.

## Contributors
